# Cleaned and corrected test sets for ML benchmark datasets

We provide the indices and labels for cleaned and corrected ML test sets.

Label errors found in [this work](https://l7.curtisnorthcutt.com/label-errors) were presented to 5 MTurk reviewers, for each erroneous example. If all 5 reviewers agreed on our proposed new label, we corrected the label, otherwise we removed the example from the test set.
