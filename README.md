# Label Errors in Benchmark ML Test Sets

**Release of corrected test sets is delayed due to media coverage. We will release in 2 weeks. Thanks for your patience.**

The cleaned and corrected test sets for all ten ML benchmark test sets, along with the indices for all label errors at https://labelerrors.com will be made available here on April 21.
